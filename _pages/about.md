I am Xuyang Yan, a passionate researcher in machine learning and autonomous systems, with expertise in 
non-stationary data stream clustering, anomaly detection, and feature selection. I received his B.S. degree 
in Electrical Engineering from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T) and 
Henan Polytechnic University in 2016. In 2018 and 2022, I earned my M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree in 
electrical engineering at NC A&T, respectively. My research interests include clustering, classification, 
feature selection, data stream analysis, active learning, anomaly detection, and the application of 
machine learning techniques in autonomous vehicles.
